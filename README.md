This sketch was written to work with a simple arcade style coin mechanism in conjunction with an HDMI switch to allow 
you to require the inserting of a coin in order to use the XBOX. While I used this for an XBOX there is nothing XBOX 
specific about the code and it should work swimmingly with any device that outputs video over HDMI.
